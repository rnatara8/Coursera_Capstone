This segment describes about the project developed to demostrate the data science capabilities to analyse data and propose a solution.

# Background:

# Data:
Extract the below details from the source and process it to segregate the hospitals in the specific region of Bangalore city.
1. Search all the hospitals list
2. Extract the adress and location
